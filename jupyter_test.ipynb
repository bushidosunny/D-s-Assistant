Older people frequently experience frailty, memory problems, and chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent trials have demonstrated the efficacy of anti-hypertensive therapy in older populations but failed to show benefits for aspirin. Statins clearly reduce CVD events in middle-aged populations. There seems to be evidence that the effect is similar in primary prevention older populations based on meta-analyses mainly from sub-groups in large trials, but this becomes less clear with increasing age. However, given differences in drug metabolism and possibly efficacy, competing co-morbidities, their effects on mortality, disability, and dementia in this age group remain to be determined.\\n'"
